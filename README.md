# ComplexSysTI_84
Complex Systems of equations solver for TI-84

Natively, the popular TI-84 calculator cannot process complex numbers in matricies. 
This program works around this problem, integrating some basic linear algebra concepts to convert complex matricies into real ones.


**Procedure:**

*(Before running, simplify equations to form: ax₁ + bx₂ + cx₃ + dx₄ = e)*
1. Start program
2. Select # of unknown variabes/equations
3. Enter coefficients for variables in squigly brackets and commas (ie. {i,7+3i,-3/i})
4. Enter solution to equation normally
5. Values for solved unknowns are stored in calculator variables 'A','B','C','D' according to how many unknowns were selected.


→Can handle systems with up to 4 unknown variables (4 linearly-independent/dependent mesh equations).

→Made with inspiration from AC RLC circuit problems, specifically for first year Electrical Engineering courses.

→Due to the nature of TI-BASIC, some characters are unavailable in rich-text format.
